Here is my plan for the next 3 months 

⚔️ OVERVIEW STRATEGY

Principle: Learn → Build → Integrate → Scale
Every 3–4 days, you’ll ship a small project to hardwire what you learned.

We’ll go in phases:

Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Core foundations + Frontend mastery

Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Backend, databases, APIs, and auth

Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Full-stack, scaling, deployment, testing, and advanced systems
