Here is my plan for the next 3 months 

‚öîÔ∏è OVERVIEW STRATEGY

Principle: Learn ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Scale
Every 3‚Äì4 days, you‚Äôll ship a small project to hardwire what you learned.

We‚Äôll go in phases:

Phase 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Core foundations + Frontend mastery

Phase 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): Backend, databases, APIs, and auth

Phase 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Full-stack, scaling, deployment, testing, and advanced systems


üß† PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS + FRONTEND MASTERY (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

Git & GitHub (init, commit, push, branches, PR)

JS basics ‚Üí Variables, functions, arrays, loops

JS single-threaded nature & event loop basics

Mini projects

Build a personal portfolio website

Push to GitHub Pages

Write a script that uses grep and pipes to analyze text files locally


Week 2 ‚Äì Deep JavaScript + DOM manipulation

JS Advanced: map, filter, reduce, Promises, async/await

DOM tree, selectors, event handling, localStorage

Dynamic UI rendering

Build a small reconciler to understand React under the hood

Project: Pure Frontend Todo App (LocalStorage + DOM manipulation)




Week 3 ‚Äì React foundations

(Use Context for global state, Tailwind for UI)



‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: BACKEND, DATABASES & APIs (Weeks 5‚Äì8)

Goal: Master Node.js, Express, REST APIs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and auth.
Deliverables: Fully functional full-stack app (Excalidraw clone).


Week 5 ‚Äì Node.js fundamentals + Express basics

What is a JS runtime (Node, Bun, Cloudflare)

Node APIs: fs, fetch, axios, events

HTTP servers, methods, routes

Express intro: routes, middlewares, body parsing, static files

Mini project: Simple REST API for Todos (no DB yet)


Week 6 ‚Äì Databases + CRUD APIs

Intro to Databases ‚Üí SQL vs NoSQL

MongoDB & Mongoose ‚Üí schemas, CRUD, relationships

PostgreSQL basics ‚Üí CREATE TABLE, CRUD queries, joins

ORMs ‚Üí Prisma basics, setup, migrations, CRUD

Mini project: Full CRUD API with MongoDB + Mongoose
Optional challenge: Rebuild same API with Postgres + Prisma


Week 7 ‚Äì Authentication + Advanced backend

JWT authentication

Environment secret management (Doppler)

File uploads, middlewares

Error handling, rate limiting basics

Project: Excalidraw clone (Full Stack)
Frontend (React) + Backend (Express + MongoDB + JWT)

Week 8 ‚Äì Advanced backend concepts

Redis intro (queues, pub/sub)

Scaling WS and HTTP servers

Node.js vs Go vs Rust discussion

Advanced comms ‚Üí WebSockets, TCP vs UDP

Build a simple WebSocket server

Mini project: Real-time Chat app
(Express + WS + React client)



üöÄ PHASE 3: ADVANCED SYSTEMS + FULL-STACK DEPLOYMENT (Weeks 9‚Äì12)

Goal: Move from developer ‚Üí engineer mindset. Learn Next.js, testing, scaling, monorepos.
Deliverables: Leetcode-style app, real-time scalable project, production deploy.

Week 9 ‚Äì Next.js + Full-stack integration

SSR vs CSR, file-based routing, API routes

Tailwind + Shadcn integration

Data fetching, NextAuth (cookie-based)

ISR, SSG

Deployment to Vercel

Project: Full-stack Notes app (Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL + NextAuth)

Week 10 ‚Äì Monorepos, CI, and DevOps

What is linting, prettier, eslint

Pre-commit hooks (husky)

Monorepos with Yarn workspaces + Turborepo

Lints in CI (GitHub Actions)

Mini project: Convert your frontend + backend into a monorepo with CI setup

Week 11 ‚Äì Testing + Advanced systems

Unit, integration, E2E tests (Vitest / Jest + Playwright)

Serverless backends (Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers)

OpenAPI spec + autogenerated clients

Rate limiting, Captcha, DDoS basics

Mini project: Add tests + rate limiting to your API

Week 12 ‚Äì Scaling + Real-time systems

WebRTC basics, SFUs, Mediasoup

GRPC, load balancers, CAP theorem

Sharding, replication, resiliency

Firebase & Strapi overview

Final Project:
Build Codeforces/Leetcode clone ‚Üí Realtime coding + scalable architecture
Deploy fully (frontend + backend + DB + auth + CI/CD)


üß© DAILY STRUCTURE (10-hour high-performance days)

Morning (4h) ‚Äì Learn new topic
Afternoon (4h) ‚Äì Build project applying that topic
Night (2h) ‚Äì Reflect + Notes + Revise + Git commit

Every Sunday ‚Üí Revision + Blog/README about what you built that week.



üíÄ HARD TRUTH

This plan is brutal. You‚Äôll fail if you just watch tutorials.
Every day must end with something you built ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs ugly.
Your brain learns through frustration ‚Üí debugging ‚Üí solution, not watching.

If you do this properly, in 3 months you‚Äôll be employable as a full-stack dev, capable of building scalable systems solo.
