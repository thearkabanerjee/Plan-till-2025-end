Phase 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): Backend, databases, APIs, and auth

Phase 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Full-stack, scaling, deployment, testing, and advanced systems

‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: BACKEND, DATABASES & APIs (Weeks 5‚Äì8)

Goal: Master Node.js, Express, REST APIs, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and auth.
Deliverables: Fully functional full-stack app (Excalidraw clone).
