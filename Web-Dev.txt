Here is my plan for the next 3 months 

⚔️ OVERVIEW STRATEGY

Principle: Learn → Build → Integrate → Scale
Every 3–4 days, you’ll ship a small project to hardwire what you learned.

We’ll go in phases:

Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Core foundations + Frontend mastery

Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Backend, databases, APIs, and auth

Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Full-stack, scaling, deployment, testing, and advanced systems


🧠 PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONS + FRONTEND MASTERY (Weeks 1–4)

Goal: Build 100% comfort with HTML, CSS, JS, DOM, Git, and React fundamentals.
Deliverables: Functional portfolio, Todo app, Gmail clone.

Week 1 – Core web + Bash + Git + JS intro

HTML5 + CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, animations)

Basic Bash (cd, ls, mkdir, touch, grep, |, reverse search)

Git & GitHub (init, commit, push, branches, PR)

JS basics → Variables, functions, arrays, loops

JS single-threaded nature & event loop basics

Mini projects

Build a personal portfolio website

Push to GitHub Pages

Write a script that uses grep and pipes to analyze text files locally
