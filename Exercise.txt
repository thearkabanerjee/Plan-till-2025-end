I need a 3 month plan to get in shape for the year end. 

* all i need to do is exercise daily.

⚙️ OVERVIEW

Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation & Fat Adaptation
Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Muscle Definition & Strength Maintenance
Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Peak Conditioning & Sculpting

Each phase builds on the last — intensity, volume, and complexity increase systematically.
